## Sipatha Shoko

I'm an experienced Software Developer and Platform Engineer.

I have professionally developed Java based solutions from version [J2SE 1.4](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=59), [J2EE 1.2](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=53), [EJB 2.1](https://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=153) using [ant](https://github.com/apache/ant).

I have kept abreast with evolving Java ecosystem transitioning to Java 21 and Jakarta 6 using [Maven](https://github.com/apache/maven) and [Gradle](https://github.com/gradle/gradle) as build tools.

[Spring Boot](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot) or [Quarkus](https://github.com/quarkusio/quarkus)? I indepth knowledge and experience of both frameworks which allows me to easily choose Quarkus.

Further to Java programming language, I'm also proficient in [Python](https://github.com/python/cpython) & [Golang](https://github.com/golang/go).

### Platform Engineering
